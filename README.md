# Important Notes
* Please refer the report.pdf for the analysis plots and conclusions.
* The directory "Analysis Plotting and Rough" contains the ipynb file which contains the code that was used to generate the plots.
* The single_thread.h has two routines, One baseline(naive) and the other optimised. Please uncomment the one which you would want to run and comment the other.
* The multi_thread.h works for even number of threads. This was done to reduce the execution time (by contention) and at the same time also having correct functionality.[more detail in report.]
